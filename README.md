# Venetian artists in Pierre-Jean Mariette's manuscript notes in XML/TEI

This project involves transcribing and encoding in XML/TEI the pages of the *Notes Manuscrites* by Pierre-Jean Mariette (1694-1774) related to Venetian artists.

## ðŸ“œ The manuscript
Pierre-Jean Mariette's manuscript notes, written until his death in 1774, bring together several handwritten documents, notably the catalogs of the print collections of EugÃ¨ne de Savoie (1663-1736) and Jean V of Portugal (1689-1750). These list the prints made after European painters from the 15th to the early 18th centuries.
The complete set of notes was acquired by the BnF's DÃ©partement des Estampes in 1827 and their shelfmark are RESERVE YA2-4 (1-11).
The lists concerning Italian painters have been reproduced in facsimile by Daniel Wildenstein et al. (ed.), *Notes manuscrites de P.-J. Mariette. Les grands peintres. I. Ã‰coles d'Italie*, Paris, 1969. [Gallica](https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k15082862)

## ðŸŽ­ The project
The aim of this project is to provide an XML/TEI encoded edition of the manuscript pages concerning the Venetian painters (Veronese, Titian, Tintoretto). By encoding Marietteâ€™s manuscript notes in XML/TEI, the project seeks to preserve the intricate structure of his catalogs, including his commentary on prints.

## ðŸŽ¨ The repository
The repository includes:

- An XML file with TEI encoding of the manuscript.

- In the folder images_transcriptions
	+ Facsimile images of the manuscript pages
	+ Plain text transcriptions

- Schemas for which the xml file is validated :
	+ DTD
	+ ODD
	+ RNG (in the out folder)
    
- An HTML version of the encoded text.
